                This game was worked on during 2020 by a team of 2. It was our take on the simulator genre, I worked on boss AI, a lot of front - end effects, daily chests, datastores, and the back end of monetization. The game has multiple worlds, the ability to rebirth, global leaderboards, and much more.

                This is a psychological - based horror story game which allows you to play with up to 5 other users and traverse through the prison, the game is based off of the unpopular SCP-450, my tasks with this game were to work on event - based dialogue systems, cutscenes, utilizing TeleportService to reserve servers and to create a tool - based FPS framework.

                Blackwater Prison is intended to be an free-roam prison roleplay game where you choose the role you take on, be a prisoner and cause havoc, or enforce the rules however you see fit as a guard. I worked primarily on the interaction system, minimap, all UI design, and a lot of back-end for this in-development game.
